Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player hand game 
where players simultaneously form one of three shapes with their hand:
rock (a fist), paper (a flat hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended).
The rules are simple: rock crushes scissors, 
scissors cuts paper,
and paper covers rock. 
If both players choose the same shape, 
it's a tie, and they play again.
